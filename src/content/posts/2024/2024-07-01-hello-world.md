## What?

I know what you're thinking, what is this "Hello, World!" thing? Well, as a programmer, it's the first thing you learn to say when you're learning a new programming language.

It's a way to test that your environment is set up correctly and that you can run code.

## Why?

It's simple, it's easy to remember, and it's a great way to give your code a test run.

## How?

If you've written a bit of Javascript before, you'll know that you can run this code in your browser's console:

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
